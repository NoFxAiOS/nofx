### Common Patterns

**Pattern 1:** TestnetChangelogOn this page CHANGELOG for Binance SPOT Testnet Last Updated: 2025-10-24 Note: All features here will only apply to the SPOT Testnet. This is not always synced with the live exchange. 2025-10-24​ SBE​ SBE: schema 3:1 (spot_3_1.xml) has been updated to support listenToken Subscription Methods for Margin Trading. REST and WebSocket API​ Following the announcement from 2025-04-01, all documentation related with listenKey for use on wss://stream.binance.com has been removed. Please refer to the list of requests and methods below for more information. The features will remain available until a future retirement announcement is made. REST API POST /api/v3/userDataStream PUT /api/v3/userDataStream DELETE /api/v3/userDataStream WebSocket API userDataStream.start userDataStream.ping userDataStream.stop 2025-10-17​ Notice: The following changes will be enabled at 2025-10-17 07:00 UTC An optional parameter, symbolStatus, has been added to the following endpoints: REST API GET /api/v3/depth GET /api/v3/ticker/price GET /api/v3/ticker/bookTicker GET /api/v3/ticker/24hr GET /api/v3/ticker/tradingDay GET /api/v3/ticker WebSocket API depth ticker.price ticker.book ticker.24hr ticker.tradingDay ticker When the parameter symbolStatus=<STATUS> is provided, only symbols whose trading status matches the specified STATUS will be included in the response: If a single symbol is specified using the symbol=<SYMBOL> parameter and its trading status does not match the given STATUS, the endpoint will return error code -1220. If multiple symbols are specified using the symbols=[...] parameter, the response will be an array that excludes any symbols whose trading status does not match STATUS. If no symbols from the symbols parameter have a trading status that matches STATUS, the response is an empty array. For endpoints where the symbol and symbols parameters are optional, omitting these parameters is treated as if all symbols had been specified in the symbols=[...] parameter. See the previous line for the behavior of symbolStatus=<STATUS>. 2025-10-08​ FIX API​ Notice: The following changes will be enabled at 2025-10-08 07:00 UTC Updated QuickFIX Schema for FIX Market Data: Updated RecvWindow (25000) to reflect microsecond support announced on 2025-08-05. Updated InstrumentList <y> message: Added fields: StartPriceRange, EndPriceRange. Made the following fields optional: MinTradeVol, MaxTradeVol, MinQtyIncrement, MarketMinTradeVol, MarketMaxTradeVol, MarketMinQtyIncrement, MinPriceIncrement. The changes to InstrumentList <y> are breaking changes. Please update to the new schema. 2025-10-01​ Data reset All data on the Spot Test Network will be deleted today according to the periodic reset procedure. See F.A.Q. for more details. REST and WebSocket API: Reminder that SBE 2:1 schema will be retired on 2025-10-02, 6 months after being deprecated. The SBE lifecycle for Testnet has been updated to reflect this change. 2025-09-24​ Notice: The following changes will be deployed on 2025-09-24, starting at 7:00 UTC and may take several hours to complete. Added an endpoint to retrieve the list of filters relevant to an account on a given symbol. This is the only endpoint that shows if an account has MAX_ASSET filters applied to it. REST API: GET /api/v3/myFilters WebSocket API: myFilters Comments in SBE: schema 3:1 (spot_3_1.xml) have been added, modified, and removed. Although there is no need for users of 3:1 to update to this version of the file, we advise updating to maintain consistency. Added documentation for filter MAX_ASSET. In Testnet only: all accounts have a MAX_ASSET filter for asset JPY with value set to 1000000. 2025-09-18​ Updated documentation for recvWindow to reflect microsecond support announced on 2025-08-05. REST API: Timing Security WebSocket API: Timing Security 2025-09-12​ The QuickFix schema for FIX Order Entry has been updated to support Pegged Orders. Updated FIX API Documentation for RecvWindow in Message Components Timing Security 2025-09-05​ Data reset All data on the Spot Test Network will be deleted today according to the periodic reset procedure. See F.A.Q. for more details. 2025-08-28​ Updated SBE FAQ section regarding legacy support to include more details on schema compatibility and explain NonRepresentable and NonRepresentableMessage. 2025-08-26​ Updated "Request Security" documentation for REST API and WebSocket API with no functional changes. 2025-08-25​ SBE: schema 3:1 (spot_3_1.xml) will be updated on 2025-08-25 at 05:00 UTC The following fields have been renamed because the SbeTool code generator has been found to generate Java code that does not compile. Although only users impacted by this issue need to update the schema, we advise all users to upgrade to the latest version to maintain consistency. Message MaxAssetFilter field limitExponent renamed to qtyExponent field limit renamed to maxQty 2025-08-19​ userDataStream.subscribe returns subscriptionId in the responses. This was missed in a previous changelog entry. 2025-08-07​ Updated FIX API documentation FIX Market Data limits: The subscription limit has always been present but was undocumented. On message processing order: Reworded and reformatted. Notice: The following will be enabled on 2025-08-08, 07:00 UTC Filter MAX_NUM_ORDER_LISTS, is enabled with the limit of 20 per symbol. 2025-08-05​ Notice: The following changes will be deployed on 2025-08-06, starting 7:00 UTC and may take several hours to complete. Please consult the Spot Test Network's homepage to be informed of the release completion. General Changes​ The pegged order functionality is now available. Exchange Information requests emit the field pegInstructionsAllowed. The following conditional fields pegPriceType, pegOffSetType, pegOffsetValues, and peggedPrice appear in responses of the following requests if the order was a pegged order: REST API GET /api/v3/order GET /api/v3/orderList GET /api/v3/openOrderList GET /api/v3/allOrders DELETE /api/v3/order DELETE /api/v3/orderList DELETE /api/v3/openOrders PUT /api/v3/order/amend/keepPriority WebSocket API order.status orderList.status allOrders order.cancel orderList.cancel openOrders.cancelAll order.amend.keepPriority FIX API OrdType(4) supports new value P(PEGGED) Tags PegOffsetValue(211), PegPriceType(1094), PegMoveType(835), and PegOffsetType(836) have been added to the following messages: NewOrderSingle <D> NewOrderList <E> OrderCancelRequestAndNewOrderSingle <XCN> When placing an order, the ExecutionReport <8> message will echo back PegInstructions, with an extra optional field PeggedPrice (839). New error messages for pegged orders are added. Please see the Errors document for more information. Changes with recvWindow: A third check is made after your message leaves the message broker just before it is sent to the Matching Engine. This does not cover potential delays inside the Matching Engine itself. recvWindow supports microseconds. The value is still specified in milliseconds, but can now take a decimal component to specify it with higher precision. This means that the parameter supports a maximum precision of 3 decimal places. (e.g. 6000.346) APIs affected: FIX API REST API WebSocket API The following requests have a new structure called specialCommission. See Commission Rates. REST API GET /api/v3/account/commission POST /api/v3/order/test with computeCommissionRates=true POST /api/v3/sor/order/test with computeCommissionRates=true WebSocket API account.commission order.test with computeCommissionRates=true sor.order.test with computeCommissionRates=true The new MAX_NUM_ORDER_AMENDS filter is enabled with a limit of 10 amendments per order. New error codes -1120 and 1211. See Errors for more information. SBE: A new schema 3:1 (spot_3_1.xml) is available. The current schema 3:0 (spot_3_0.xml) is deprecated and will be retired in 6 months as per our schema deprecation policy. Changes in schema 3:1: ExchangeInfoResponse: new field pegInstructionsAllowed ExecutionReportEvent: new fields pricePeg, pricePegOffsetLevel, peggedPrice UserDataStreamSubscribeResponse: new field subscriptionId New field subscriptionId for all user data stream events. Field apiKey renamed to loggedOnApiKey for WebSocketSessionLogonResponse, WebSocketSessionStatusResponse and WebSocketSessionLogoutResponse OrderTestWithCommissionsResponse: 2 new fields specialCommissionForOrderMaker and specialCommissionForOrderTaker AccountCommissionResponse: 4 new fields specialCommissionMaker, specialCommissionTaker, specialCommissionBuyer and specialCommissionSeller Support for EXCHANGE_MAX_NUM_ORDER_LISTS, MAX_NUM_ORDER_LISTS, and MAX_NUM_ORDER_AMENDS filters. ExecutionReportEvent: fields rejectReason and origClientOrderId now show their default values in SBE format to match the JSON format. NonRepresentableMessage: New message added to represent a message that cannot be represented in this schema ID and version. Receipt of this message indicates that something should be available, but it is not representable using the SBE schema currently in use. Query order lists requests will first query the data in the cache, and if it cannot be found will query the database. REST API: GET /api/v3/openOrderLists WebSocket API: openOrderLists.status Orders with cumulative quantity of 0 in the final state EXPIRED_IN_MATCH (i.e. the order expired due to STP) will be archived after 90 days. Bug fix: The Matching Engine no longer accepts order lists that exceed the order count filter limits. Affected filters: MAX_NUM_ORDERS MAX_ALGO_ORDERS MAX_ICEBERG_ORDERS EXCHANGE_MAX_NUM_ORDERS EXCHANGE_MAX_ALGO_ORDERS EXCHANGE_MAX_ICEBERG_ORDERS WebSocket API​ A single WebSocket connection can subscribe to multiple User Data Streams at once. Only one subscription per account is allowed on a single connection. Method userDataStream.subscribe.signature has been added that allows you to subscribe to the User Data Stream without needing to login first. This also doesn’t require an Ed25519 API Key, and can work with any API Key type. For SBE support you need to use schema 3:1 at least. Method session.subscriptions has been added that lists all the subscriptions active for the current session. The meaning of the field userDataStream in the session requests has changed slightly. Previously, this returned true if you were subscribed to the user data stream of your logged-on account. Now it returns true if you have at least one active user data stream subscription true - If there is at least one subscription active false - If there are no active subscriptions userDataStream.unsubscribe supports closing multiple subscriptions. When called with no parameter, this will close all subscriptions. When called with subscriptionId, this will attempt to close the subscription matching that Id, if it exists. The authorization for this request has been changed to NONE. User Data Stream​ Field subscriptionId has been added to the User Data Stream events payload when listening through the WebSocket API. This will identify which subscription the event is coming from. FIX API​ When a client sends a reject message, the FIX API will no longer send the client back a Reject <3> message. Error messages are clearer when a tag is invalid, missing a value, or when the field value is empty or malformed If the tag number was invalid, you will receive the error: {"code": -1169, "msg": "Invalid tag number."} If a valid tag was specified without a value, you will receive the error: {"code": -1177, "msg": "Tag specified without a value."} If the field value was empty or malformed, you will still receive the error: {"code": -1102, "msg": "Field value was empty or malformed."} 2025-07-02​ Data reset All data on the Spot Test Network will be deleted today according to the periodic reset procedure. (see F.A.Q. for more details) 2025-06-04​ Data reset All data on the Spot Test Network will be deleted today according to the periodic reset procedure. (see F.A.Q. for more details) 2025-05-28​ Documented API timeout value and error under General API Information for each API: FIX REST WebSocket 2025-05-22​ REST and WebSocket API: Reminder that SBE 2:0 schema will be retired on 2025-05-28, 6 months after being deprecated. The SBE lifecycle for Testnet has been updated to reflect this change. 2025-05-21​ Notice: The following changes will happen at 2025-05-21 7:00 UTC. The previous behavior of recvWindow on FIX, REST, and WebSocket APIs will be augmented by an additional check. To review, the existing behavior is: If timestamp is greater than serverTime + 1 second at receipt of the request, the request is rejected. Rejection by this check increments message limits (FIX API) and IP limits (REST and WebSocket APIs), but not Unfilled Order Count (order placement endpoints of all APIs). If the difference between timestamp and serverTime at receipt of the request is greater than recvWindow, the request is rejected. Rejection by this check increments message limits (FIX API) and IP limits (REST and WebSocket APIs) but not Unfilled Order Count (order placement endpoints of all APIs). The additional check is: Just before a request is forwarded to the Matching Engine, if the difference between timestamp and the current serverTime is greater than recvWindow, the request is rejected. Rejection by this check increments message limits (FIX API), IP limits (REST and WebSocket APIs), and Unfilled Order Count (order placement endpoints of all APIs). The documentation for Timing security has been updated to reflect the additional check. REST API WebSocket API FIX API Fixed a bug in FIX Market Data message InstrumentList <y>. Previously, the value of NoRelatedSym(146) could have been incorrect. 2025-04-29​ Features that currently require an Ed25519 API key will soon be opened up to HMAC and RSA keys. For example, subscribing to User Data Stream in WebSocket API will be possible with any API key type before listenKeys are removed. Users are still encouraged to migrate to Ed25519 API keys as they are more secure and performant on Binance Spot Trading. More details to come. 2025-04-25​ Notice: The following changes will happen at 2025-04-25 09:00 UTC. The following request weights will be increased from 1 to 4: REST API: PUT /api/v3/order/amend/keepPriority WebSocket API: order.amend.keepPriority The documentation for both REST and WebSocket API has been updated to reflect the upcoming changes. Clarified that SEQNUM in the FIX-API is a 32-bit unsigned integer that rolls over. This has been the SEQNUM data type since the inception of the FIX-API. 2025-04-21​ Order Amend Keep Priority is now enabled on all symbols. Self-trade prevention mode DECREMENT is now enabled on all symbols. 2025-04-01​ Notice: The following changes will be deployed tomorrow April 2, 2025 starting at 7:00 UTC and may take several hours to complete. Please consult the Spot Test Network's homepage to be informed of the release completion. New Features​ Order Amend Keep Priority is now available. FIX API: New Order Entry Messages OrderAmendKeepPriorityRequest and OrderAmendReject REST API: PUT /api/v3/order/amend/keepPriority WebSocket API: order.amend.keepPriority You can check the new allowAmend field in Exchange Information Requests to see if it's enabled on a given symbol: REST API: GET /api/v3/exchangeInfo WebSocket API: exchangeInfo Self-trade prevention mode DECREMENT is now available. Instead of expiring one or both orders, DECREMENT mode decreases the available quantity of both orders by increasing the prevented quantity of both orders by the amount of the prevented match. This can expire the orders if their filled quantity + prevented quantity >= order quantity. You can check the allowedSelfTradePreventionModes field in Exchange Information Requests to see if this mode is enabled on a given symbol. General Changes​ Important: The following legacy URLs will be removed in May 2025. Please change to the new URLs as soon as possible: Legacy URLLatest URLwss://testnet.binance.vision/ws-api/v3wss://ws-api.testnet.binance.vision/ws-api/v3wss://testnet.binance.vision/wswss://stream.testnet.binance.vision/ws Behavior when querying and/or canceling with orderId and origClientOrderId/cancelOrigClientOrderId: The behavior when both parameters were provided was not consistent across all endpoints. Moving forward, when both parameters are provided, the order is first searched for using its orderId, and if found, origClientOrderId/cancelOrigClientOrderId is checked against that order. If both conditions pass, the request succeeds. If both conditions are not met the request is rejected. Affected requests: REST API: GET /api/v3/order DELETE /api/v3/order POST /api/v3/order/cancelReplace WebSocket API: order.status order.cancel order.cancelReplace FIX API OrderCancelRequest <F> OrderCancelRequestAndNewOrderSingle <XCN> Behavior when canceling with listOrderId and listClientOrderId: The behavior when both parameters were provided was not consistent across all endpoints. Moving forward, when both parameters are passed, the order list is first searched for using its listOrderId, and if found, listClientOrderId is checked against that order list. If both conditions are not met the request is rejected. Affected requests: REST API DELETE /api/v3/orderList WebSocket API orderList.cancel Previously, the request weight for myTrades was 20 regardless of the parameters provided. Now, if you provide orderId, the request weight is 5. REST API: GET /api/v3/myTrades WebSocket API: myTrades If the unfilled order count for intervalNum:DAY is exceeded, the unfilled order count for intervalNum:SECOND is no longer incremented. Change when querying and deleting orders: When neither orderId nor origClientOrderId are present, the request is now rejected with -1102 instead of -1128. Affected requests: REST API: GET /api/v3/order DELETE /api/v3/order WebSocket API order.status order.cancel FIX API OrderCancelRequest <F> New Error code -2038 for order amend keep priority requests that fail. New messages for error code -1034. FIX API​ The QuickFix schema for FIX OE is updated to support the Order Amend Keep Priority feature and new STP mode, DECREMENT. FIX Order Entry connection limits will be a maximum of 10 concurrent connections per account. The connection rate limits are now enforced. Note that these limits are checked independently for both the account and the IP address. FIX Order Entry: 15 connection attempts within 30 seconds FIX Drop Copy: 15 connection attempts within 30 seconds FIX Market Data: 300 connection attempts within 300 seconds News <B> contains a countdown until disconnection in the Headline field. Following the completion of this update, when the server enters maintenance, a News message will be sent to clients every 10 seconds for 10 minutes. After this period, clients will be logged out and their sessions will be closed. OrderCancelRequest <F> and OrderCancelRequestAndNewOrderSingle <XCN> will now allow both orderId and clientOrderId. FIX API verifies that EncryptMethod(98) is 0 at Logon <A>. User Data Streams​ Receiving user data streams on stream.testnet.binance.vision using a listenKey is now deprecated. This feature will be removed from our systems at a later date. Instead, you should get user data updates by subscribing to the User Data Stream on the WebSocket API. This should offer slightly better performance (lower latency). This requires the use of an Ed25519 API Key. In a future update, information about the base WebSocket endpoint for the User Data Streams will be removed. In a future update, the following requests will be removed from the documentation: POST /api/v3/userDataStream PUT /api/v3/userDataStream DELETE /api/v3/userDataStream userDataStream.start userDataStream.ping userDataStream.stop The User Data Stream documentation will remain as reference for the payloads you can receive. SBE​ A new schema 3:0 (spot_3_0.xml) is now available. The current schema 2:1 (spot_2_1.xml) is now deprecated and will be retired in 6 months as per our schema deprecation policy. Note that trying to use schema 3:0 before it is released will result in an error. Changes in schema 3:0: Support for Order Amend Keep Priority: Added field amendAllowed to ExchangeInfoResponse. New Messages OrderAmendmentsResponse and OrderAmendKeepPriorityResponse Breaking changes: All enums now have a NON_REPRESENTABLE variant. This will be used to encode new enum values in the future, which would be incompatible with 3:0. New enum variant DECREMENT for selfTradePreventionMode and allowedSelfTradePreventionModes symbolStatus enum values AUCTION_MATCH, PRE_TRADING and POST_TRADING have been removed. Fields usedSor, orderCapacity, workingFloor, preventedQuantity, and matchType are no longer optional. Field orderCreationTime in ExecutionReportEvent is now optional. When using deprecated schema 2:1 on the WebSocket API to listen to the User Data Stream: ListStatusEvent field listStatusType will be rendered as ExecStarted when it should have been Updated. Upgrade to schema 3:0 to get the correct value. ExecutionReportEvent field selfTradePreventionMode will be rendered as None when it should have been Decrement. This only happens when executionType is TradePrevention. ExecutionReportEvent field orderCreationTime will be rendered as -1 when it has no value. All schemas below 3:0 are unable to represent responses for Order Amend Keep Priority requests and any response that could contain the STP mode DECREMENT (e.g. Exchange Information, order placement, order cancelation, or querying the status of your order). When a response cannot be represented in the requested schema, an error is returned. 2025-03-31​ Added a clarification on the performance of canceling an order. 2025-03-13​ Notice: The following changes will happen on March 13,2025 at 05:00 UTC: FIX Drop Copy sessions will have a limit of 60 messages per minute. FIX Market Data sessions will have a limit of 2000 messages per minute. The FIX API documentation has been updated to reflect the upcoming changes. 2025-03-05​ Notice: This is in the process of being deployed. Please consult the Spot Test Network's homepage to be informed of the release completion. The following request weights will be increased from 2 to 4: REST API: GET /api/v3/aggTrade WebSocket API: trades.aggregate The documentation for both REST and WebSocket API has been updated to reflect the upcoming changes. 2025-02-28​ SBE Market Data Streams are now available. These streams offer a smaller payload and should offer better latency than the equivalent JSON streams for a subset of latency-sensitive market data streams. Streams available in SBE format: Real-time: trade stream Real-time: best bid/ask Every 100 ms: diff. depth Every 100 ms: partial book depth For more information please refer to the SBE Market Data Streams. 2025-02-05​ Notice: These changes will be deployed starting at 7:00 UTC, and may take several hours to complete. The following changes will apply to WebSocket Market Data Streams, User Data Streams, and the WebSocket API: Our WebSocket services will send a ping frame every 20 seconds instead of 3 minutes. The allowed pong delay will be 1 minute instead of 10 minutes. The documentation for these services have been updated to reflect the change. AggressorSide (2446) is now rendered in the FIX Market Data Trade Stream. The QuickFIX schema file has also been updated. Please download the latest schema before the Spot Testnet upgrade is completed. 2024-12-17​ FIX Market Data is now available. The FIX API documentation for SPOT Testnet has been updated regarding this feature. Please refer to this link for the QuickFIX Schema for FIX Market Data. 2024-11-27​ Note: These changes will be deployed live starting 2024-11-28 and may take several hours for all features to work as intended. New Feature: Microsecond support: The system now supports microseconds in all related time and/or timestamp fields. Microsecond support is opt-in, by default the requests and responses still use milliseconds. Examples in documentation are also using milliseconds for the foreseeable future. WebSocket Streams A new optional parameter timeUnit can be used in the connection URL to select the time unit. For example: /stream?streams=btcusdt@trade&timeUnit=millisecond Supported values are: MILLISECOND millisecond MICROSECOND microsecond If the time unit is not selected, milliseconds will be used by default. REST API A new optional header X-MBX-TIME-UNIT can be sent in the request to select the time unit. Supported values: MILLISECOND millisecond MICROSECOND microsecond The time unit affects time-related parameters in requests (e.g, startTime, endTime, timestamp). The time unit affects timestamp fields in responses (e.g., time, transactTime). If the time unit is not selected, milliseconds will be used by default. WebSocket API A new optional parameter timeUnit can be used in the connection URL to select the time unit. Supported values: MILLISECOND millisecond MICROSECOND microsecond The time unit affects time-related parameters in requests (e.g, startTime, endTime, timestamp). The time unit affects timestamp fields in responses (e.g., time, transactTime). If the time unit is not selected, milliseconds will be used by default. User Data Streams A new optional parameter timeUnit can be used in the connection URL to select the time unit. Supported values MILLISECOND MICROSECOND. microsecond millisecond General Changes: Fixed a bug that prevented orders from being placed when submitting OCOs on the BUY side without providing a stopPrice. TAKE_PROFIT and TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT support has been added for OCOs. Previously OCOs could only be composed by the following order types: LIMIT_MAKER + STOP_LOSS LIMIT_MAKER + STOP_LOSS_LIMIT Now OCOs can be composed of the following order types: LIMIT_MAKER + STOP_LOSS LIMIT_MAKER + STOP_LOSS_LIMIT TAKE_PROFIT + STOP_LOSS TAKE_PROFIT + STOP_LOSS_LIMIT TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT + STOP_LOSS TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT + STOP_LOSS_LIMIT This is supported by the following requests: POST /api/v3/orderList/oco POST /api/v3/orderList/otoco orderList.place.oco orderList.place.otoco NewOrderList<E> Error code -1167 will be obsolete after this update and will be removed from the documentation in a later update. Timestamp parameters now reject values too far into the past or the future. To be specific, the parameter will be rejected if: timestamp before 2017-01-01 (less than 1483228800000) timestamp is more than 10 seconds after the current time (e.g., if current time is 1729745280000 then it is an error to use 1729745291000 or greater) If startTime and/or endTime values are outside of range, the values will be adjusted to fit the correct range. The field for quote order quantity (origQuoteOrderQty) has been added to responses that previously did not have it. Note that for order placement endpoints the field will only appear for requests with newOrderRespType set to RESULT or FULL. Please refer to the table for requests with origQuoteOrderQty: ServiceRequestRESTPOST /api/v3/orderPOST /api/v3/sor/orderPOST /api/v3/order/ocoPOST /api/v3/orderList/ocoPOST /api/v3/orderList/otoPOST /api/v3/orderList/otocoDELETE /api/v3/orderDELETE /api/v3/orderListPOST /api/v3/order/cancelReplaceWebSocket APIorder.placesor.order.placeorderList.placeorderList.place.ocoorderList.place.otoorderList.place.otocoorder.cancelorderList.cancelorder.cancelReplace SBE A new schema 2:1 spot_2_1.xml has been released. The current schema 2:0 spot_2_0.xml will thus be deprecated, and retired from the API in 6 months as per our schema deprecation policy. Schema 2:1 is a backward compatible update of schema 2:0. You will always receive payloads in 2:1 format when you request either schema 2:0 or 2:1. Changes in SBE schema 2:1: New field origQuoteOrderQty in order placement/cancellation responses (Note: Decoders generated using the 2:0 schema will skip this field.): NewOrderResultResponse NewOrderFullResponse CancelOrderResponse NewOrderListResultResponse NewOrderListFullResponse CancelOrderListResponse WebSocket API only: New field userDataStream in session status responses: WebSocketSessionLogonResponse WebSocketSessionStatusResponse WebSocketSessionLogoutResponse WebSocket API only: New messages for User Data Stream support: UserDataStreamSubscribeResponse UserDataStreamUnsubscribeResponse BalanceUpdateEvent EventStreamTerminatedEvent ExecutionReportEvent ExternalLockUpdateEvent ListStatusEvent OutboundAccountPositionEvent WebSocket API You can now subscribe to User Data Stream events through your WebSocket API connection. Note: This feature is only available for users of Ed25519 API keys. Note: New SBE schema 2:1 is required for User Data Stream subscriptions in SBE format. New requests: userDataStream.subscribe userDataStream.unsubscribe Changes to session.logon, session.status, and session.logout Added a new field userDataStream indicating if the user data stream subscription is active. Fixed a bug where you wouldn't receive a new listenKey using userDataStream.start after session.logon User Data Stream WebSocket API only: New event eventStreamTerminated is emitted when you either logout from your websocket session or you have unsubscribed from the user data stream. New event externalLockUpdate is sent when your spot wallet balance is locked/unlocked by an external system. FIX API The schema has been updated with a new Administrative message News <B>, which can be used for all FIX services. Receiving this message indicates that your connection is about to be closed. Note: This message will be available in the live exchange at a later date. 2024-11-05​ Note: This is in the process of being deployed. Please consult the Spot Test Network's homepage to be informed of the release completion. Changes to Exchange Information (i.e. GET /api/v3/exchangeInfo from REST and exchangeInfo for WebSocket API). A new optional parameter showPermissionSets can be used to hide the permissions from permissionsSets; This can be used for a reduced payload size. A new optional parameter symbolStatus can now be used to only show symbols with the specified status. (e.g. TRADING, HALT, BREAK) 2024-10-02​ REST and WebSocket API: Reminder that SBE 1:0 schema will be disabled on 2024-10-04, 6 months after being deprecated, as per our SBE policy. The SBE lifecycle for Testnet has been updated to reflect this change. 2024-09-04​ Spot Testnet now supports Unfilled Order Count. Please refer to this page on how you can decrement your unfilled order count when placing orders. The documentation has been updated to reflect the wording. 2024-08-16​ General Changes: New error messages have been added when quote quantity market orders (aka reverse market orders) are rejected in low-liquidity situations. 2024-08-07​ The QuickFIX schema has been modified. 2024-07-23​ Note: This will be deployed starting around 7am UTC. Please consult the Spot Test Network's homepage to be informed of the release completion. FIX Drop Copy sessions are now supported on the Spot Test Network. New API Key permission FIX_API_READ_ONLY has been introduced. 2024-07-17​ General changes: Fixed a bug where klines had incorrect timestamps. REST API: GET /api/v3/klines and GET /api/v3/uiKlines with timeZone parameter WebSocket API: klines and uiKlines with timeZone parameter WebSocket Streams: <symbol>@kline_<interval>@+08:00 streams 2024-06-21​ FIX API will be available today (2024-06-21) on the Spot Test Network. Please consult the Spot Test Network's homepage to be informed of the release completion. Using the FIX API requires an Ed25519 API Key with the FIX_API permission. The release date on the live exchange has not been determined. 2024-06-05​ WebSocket Streams Buyer order ID (b) and Seller order ID (a) have been removed from the Trade streams. (i.e. <symbol>@trade) To monitor if your order was part of a trade, please listen to the User Data Streams. 2024-05-30​ WebSocket API wss://ws-api.testnet.binance.vision/ws-api/v3 is now the primary URL for the Spot Testnet WebSocket API. Other URLs will be phased out over time. WebSocket Streams wss://stream.testnet.binance.vision/ws and wss://stream.testnet.binance.vision/stream are now the primary URLs for the Spot Testnet WebSocket Streams. Other URLs will be phased out over time. 2024-05-23​ REST API orderRateLimitExceededMode has been added to POST /api/v3/order/cancelReplace WebSocket API orderRateLimitExceededMode has been added to order.cancelReplace WebSocket Streams Kline/Candlestick streams can now support a UTC+8:00 timezone offset. (e.g. btcusdt@kline_1d@+08:00) 2024-05-02​ One-Triggers-the-Other (OTO) orders and One-Triggers-a-One-Cancels-The-Other (OTOCO) orders are now enabled. New requests have been added: REST API: POST /api/v3/orderList/oto POST /api/v3/orderList/otoco WebSocket API: orderList.place.oto orderList.place.otoco 2024-04-04​ General changes: Symbol permission information in Exchange Information responses has moved from field permissions to field permissionSets. Field permissions will be empty and will be removed in a future release. Previously, "permissions":["SPOT","MARGIN"] meant that you could place an order on the symbol if your account had SPOT or MARGIN permissions. The equivalent is "permissionSets":[["SPOT","MARGIN"]]. (Note the extra set of square brackets.) Each array of permissions inside the permissionSets array is called a "permission set". Symbol permissions can now be more complex. "permissionSets":[["SPOT","MARGIN"],["TRD_GRP_004","TRD_GRP_005"]] means that you may place an order on the symbol if your account has SPOT or MARGIN permissions and TRD_GRP_004 or TRD_GRP_005 permissions. There may be an arbitrary number of permission sets in a symbol's permissionSets. The weight of the following requests has increased from 10 to 25: GET /api/v3/trades GET /api/v3/historicalTrades trades.recent trades.historical REST API The POST /api/v3/order/oco endpoint is now deprecated on the REST API. You should use the new POST /api/v3/orderList/oco endpoint instead. Note that this new endpoint uses different parameters. POST /api/v3/order/oco has been removed from the Rest API documentation for SPOT Testnet. otoAllowed will now appear on GET /api/v3/exchangeInfo, that indicates if One-Triggers-the-Other (OTO) orders are supported on that symbol. WebSocket API The orderList.place request is now deprecated on the WebSocket API. You should now use the new orderList.place.oco request instead. Note that this new request uses different parameters. orderList.place has been removed from the WebSocket API documentation for SPOT Testnet. otoAllowed will now appear on exchangeInfo, that indicates if One-Triggers-the-Other (OTO) orders are supported on that symbol. SBE A new schema 2:0 spot_2_0.xml has been released for SPOT Testnet. The current schema, 1:0 spot_1_0.xml, will thus be deprecated and retired from the Testnet APIs in 6 months as per our schema deprecation policy. When using schema 1:0 on REST API or WebSocket API, group "permissions" in message "ExchangeInfoResponse" will always be empty. Upgrade to schema 2:0 to find permission information in group "permissionSets". See General changes above for more details. Responses for deprecated OCO requests are supported by both schema 1:0 and 2:0 2024-03-13​ General changes: GET /api/v3/account has a new optional parameter omitZeroBalances, allowing to hide all zero balances account.status has a new optional parameter omitZeroBalances allowing to hide all zero balances.

**Pattern 3:** FAQsOrder Count DecrementOn this page Spot Unfilled Order Count Rules To ensure a fair and orderly Spot market, we limit the rate at which new orders may be placed. The rate limit applies to the number of new, unfilled orders placed within a time interval. That is, orders which are partially or fully filled do not count against the rate limit. [!NOTE] Unfilled order rate limit rewards efficient traders. So long as your orders trade, you can keep trading. More information: How do filled orders affect the rate limit? What are the current rate limits?​ You can query current rate limits using the "exchange information" request. The "rateLimitType": "ORDERS" indicates the current unfilled order rate limit. Please refer to the API documentation: APIRequestFIX APILimitQuery<XLQ>REST APIGET /api/v3/exchangeInfoWebSocket APIexchangeInfo [!IMPORTANT] Order placement requests are also affected by the general request rate limits on REST and WebSocket API and the message limits on FIX API. If you send too many requests at a high rate, you will be blocked by the API. How does the unfilled ORDERS rate limit work?​ Every successful request to place an order adds to the unfilled order count for the current time interval. If too many unfilled orders accumulate during the interval, subsequent requests will be rejected. For example, if the unfilled order rate limit is 100 per 10 seconds: { "rateLimitType": "ORDERS", "interval": "SECOND", "intervalNum": 10, "limit": 100} then you can place at most 100 new orders between 12:34:00 and 12:34:10, then 100 more from 12:34:10 to 12:34:20, and so on. [!TIP] If the newly placed orders receive fills, your unfilled order count decreases and you may place more orders during the time interval. More information: How do filled orders affect the rate limit? When an order is rejected by the system due to the unfilled order rate limit, the HTTP status code is set to 429 Too Many Requests and the error code is -1015 "Too many new orders". If you encounter these errors, please stop sending orders until the affected rate limit interval expires. Please refer to the API documentation: APIDocumentationFIX APIUnfilled Order CountREST APIUnfilled Order CountWebSocket APIUnfilled Order Count Is the unfilled order count tracked by IP address?​ Unfilled order count is tracked by (sub)account. Unfilled order count is shared across all IP addresses, all API keys, and all APIs. How do filled orders affect the unfilled order count?​ When an order is filled for the first time (partially or fully), your unfilled order count is decremented by one order for all intervals of the ORDERS rate limit. Effectively, orders that trade do not count towards the rate limit, allowing efficient traders to keep placing new orders. Certain orders provide additional incentive: Orders that do not fill immediately (that is, first fill in the maker phase). Orders that fill large quantities. In these cases the unfilled order count may be decremented by more than one order for each order that starts trading. Notes: The examples only give a general idea of the behavior. The 10-second interval is used for simplicity. The actual configuration on the live exchange may be different. There is a short delay between the order being filled and the unfilled order count update. Please be careful when your unfilled order count is close to the limit. Please refer to How does unfilled ORDERS rate limit work? to see how you can monitor the unfilled order count depending on the API. Example 1 — taker: TimeActionUnfilled order count00:00:00000:00:01Place LIMIT order A1 — new order (+1)00:00:02Place LIMIT order B2 — new order (+1)(order B partially filled)1 — first fill as taker (−1)00:00:03Place LIMIT order C2 — new order (+1)00:00:04(order B partially filled)200:00:04(order B filled)200:00:05Place MARKET order D3 — new order (+1)(order D fully filled)2 — first fill as taker (−1) Note how for every taker order that immediately trades, the unfilled order count is decremented later, allowing you to keep placing orders. Example 2 — maker: TimeActionUnfilled order count00:00:00000:00:01Place LIMIT order A1 — new order (+1)00:00:01Place LIMIT order B2 — new order (+1)00:00:02Place LIMIT order C3 — new order (+1)00:00:02Place LIMIT order D4 — new order (+1)00:00:02Place LIMIT order E5 — new order (+1)00:00:03(order A partially filled)0 — first fill as maker (−5)00:00:04Place LIMIT order F1 — new order (+1)00:00:04Place LIMIT order G2 — new order (+1)00:00:05(order A partially filled)200:00:05(order A filled)200:00:05(order B partially filled)0 — first fill as maker (−5)00:00:06Place LIMIT order H1 — new order (+1) Note how for every maker order that is filled later, the unfilled order count is decremented by a higher amount, allowing you to place more orders. How do canceled or expired orders affect the unfilled order count?​ Canceling an order does not change the unfilled order count. Expired orders also do not change the unfilled order count. Example: TimeActionUnfilled order count00:00:00000:00:01Place LIMIT order A1 — new order (+1)00:00:02Cancel order A100:00:02Place LIMIT order B2 — new order (+1)00:00:03Place LIMIT FOK order C3 — new order (+1)(order C is fully filled)2 — fill (−1)00:00:05Place LIMIT order D3 — new order (+1)00:00:06Place LIMIT FOK order E4 — new order (+1)(order E expires with no fill)400:00:07Cancel order D400:00:07Place LIMIT order F5 — new order (+1) Which time zone does "interval":"DAY" use?​ UTC What happens if I placed an order yesterday but it is filled the next day?​ New order fills decrease your current unfilled order count regardless of when the orders were placed. Example: TimeActionUnfilled order count2024-01-01 09:00Place 5 orders: 1..552024-01-02 00:00(rate limit interval reset)02024-01-02 09:00Place 10 orders: 6..15102024-01-02 12:00(orders 1..5 are filled)52024-01-02 13:00(orders 6..10 are filled)02024-01-02 14:00Place 2 orders: 16, 1722024-01-02 15:00(orders 11..15 are filled)0 Note: You do not get credit for order fills. That is, once the unfilled order count is down to zero, additional fills will not decrease it further. New orders will increase the count as usual.PreviousSOR FAQNextSBE FAQWhat are the current rate limits?How does the unfilled ORDERS rate limit work?Is the unfilled order count tracked by IP address?How do filled orders affect the unfilled order count?How do canceled or expired orders affect the unfilled order count?Which time zone does "interval":"DAY" use?What happens if I placed an order yesterday but it is filled the next day?

**Pattern 4:** WebSocket StreamsOn this page WebSocket Streams for Binance (2025-01-28) General WSS information​ The base endpoint is: wss://stream.binance.com:9443 or wss://stream.binance.com:443. Streams can be accessed either in a single raw stream or in a combined stream. Raw streams are accessed at /ws/<streamName> Combined streams are accessed at /stream?streams=<streamName1>/<streamName2>/<streamName3> Combined stream events are wrapped as follows: {"stream":"<streamName>","data":<rawPayload>} All symbols for streams are lowercase A single connection to stream.binance.com is only valid for 24 hours; expect to be disconnected at the 24 hour mark The WebSocket server will send a ping frame every 20 seconds. If the WebSocket server does not receive a pong frame back from the connection within a minute the connection will be disconnected. When you receive a ping, you must send a pong with a copy of ping's payload as soon as possible. Unsolicited pong frames are allowed, but will not prevent disconnection. It is recommended that the payload for these pong frames are empty. The base endpoint wss://data-stream.binance.vision can be subscribed to receive only market data messages. User data stream is NOT available from this URL. All time and timestamp related fields are milliseconds by default. To receive the information in microseconds, please add the parameter timeUnit=MICROSECOND or timeUnit=microsecond in the URL. For example: /stream?streams=btcusdt@trade&timeUnit=MICROSECOND WebSocket Limits​ WebSocket connections have a limit of 5 incoming messages per second. A message is considered: A PING frame A PONG frame A JSON controlled message (e.g. subscribe, unsubscribe) A connection that goes beyond the limit will be disconnected; IPs that are repeatedly disconnected may be banned. A single connection can listen to a maximum of 1024 streams. There is a limit of 300 connections per attempt every 5 minutes per IP. Live Subscribing/Unsubscribing to streams​ The following data can be sent through the WebSocket instance in order to subscribe/unsubscribe from streams. Examples can be seen below. The id is used as an identifier to uniquely identify the messages going back and forth. The following formats are accepted: 64-bit signed integer alphanumeric strings; max length 36 null In the response, if the result received is null this means the request sent was a success for non-query requests (e.g. Subscribing/Unsubscribing).

Buffer the events received from the stream. Note the U of the first event you received. Get a depth snapshot from https://api.binance.com/api/v3/depth?symbol=BNBBTC&limit=5000. If the lastUpdateId from the snapshot is strictly less than the U from step 2, go back to step 3. In the buffered events, discard any event where u is <= lastUpdateId of the snapshot. The first buffered event should now have lastUpdateId within its [U;u] range. Set your local order book to the snapshot. Its update ID is lastUpdateId. Apply the update procedure below to all buffered events, and then to all subsequent events received. To apply an event to your local order book, follow this update procedure: If the event u (last update ID) is < the update ID of your local order book, ignore the event. If the event U (first update ID) is > the update ID of your local order book, something went wrong. Discard your local order book and restart the process from the beginning. For each price level in bids (b) and asks (a), set the new quantity in the order book: If the price level does not exist in the order book, insert it with new quantity. If the quantity is zero, remove the price level from the order book. Set the order book update ID to the last update ID (u) in the processed event. [!NOTE] Since depth snapshots retrieved from the API have a limit on the number of price levels (5000 on each side maximum), you won't learn the quantities for the levels outside of the initial snapshot unless they change. So be careful when using the information for those levels, since they might not reflect the full view of the order book. However, for most use cases, seeing 5000 levels on each side is enough to understand the market and trade effectively.

**Pattern 5:** TestnetWebSocket StreamsOn this page WebSocket Streams for Binance SPOT Testnet Last Updated: 2025-04-01 General WSS information​ The base endpoint is: wss://stream.testnet.binance.vision/ws. Streams can be accessed either in a single raw stream or in a combined stream Raw streams are accessed at /ws/<streamName> Combined streams are accessed at /stream?streams=<streamName1>/<streamName2>/<streamName3> Combined stream events are wrapped as follows: {"stream":"<streamName>","data":<rawPayload>} All symbols for streams are lowercase All time and timestamp related fields are milliseconds by default. To receive the information in microseconds, please add the parameter timeUnit=MICROSECOND or timeUnit=microsecond in the URL. For example: /stream?streams=btcusdt@trade&timeUnit=MICROSECOND A single connection to stream.binance.com is only valid for 24 hours; expect to be disconnected at the 24 hour mark The WebSocket server will send a ping frame every 20 seconds. If the WebSocket server does not receive a pong frame back from the connection within a minute, the connection will be disconnected. When you receive a ping, you must send a pong with a copy of ping's payload as soon as possible. Unsolicited pong frames are allowed, but will not prevent disconnection. It is recommended that the payload for these pong frames are empty. The base endpoint wss://data-stream.binance.vision can be subscribed to receive only market data messages. User data stream is NOT available from this URL. All time and timestamp related fields are milliseconds by default. To receive the information in microseconds, please add the parameter timeUnit=MICROSECOND or timeUnit=microsecond in the URL. For example: /stream?streams=btcusdt@trade&timeUnit=MICROSECOND WebSocket Limits​ WebSocket connections have a limit of 5 incoming messages per second. A message is considered: A PING frame A PONG frame A JSON controlled message (e.g. subscribe, unsubscribe) A connection that goes beyond the limit will be disconnected; IPs that are repeatedly disconnected may be banned. A single connection can listen to a maximum of 1024 streams. There is a limit of 300 connections per attempt every 5 minutes per IP. Live Subscribing/Unsubscribing to streams​ The following data can be sent through the WebSocket instance in order to subscribe/unsubscribe from streams. Examples can be seen below. The id is used as an identifier to uniquely identify the messages going back and forth. The following formats are accepted: 64-bit signed integer alphanumeric strings; max length 36 null In the response, if the result received is null this means the request sent was a success for non-query requests (e.g. Subscribing/Unsubscribing). Subscribe to a stream​ Request { "method": "SUBSCRIBE", "params": [ "btcusdt@aggTrade", "btcusdt@depth" ], "id": 1} Response { "result": null, "id": 1} Unsubscribe to a stream​ Request { "method": "UNSUBSCRIBE", "params": [ "btcusdt@depth" ], "id": 312} Response { "result": null, "id": 312} Listing Subscriptions​ Request { "method": "LIST_SUBSCRIPTIONS", "id": 3} Response { "result": [ "btcusdt@aggTrade" ], "id": 3} Setting Properties​ Currently, the only property that can be set is whether combined stream payloads are enabled or not. The combined property is set to false when connecting using /ws/ ("raw streams") and true when connecting using /stream/. Request { "method": "SET_PROPERTY", "params": [ "combined", true ], "id": 5} Response { "result": null, "id": 5} Retrieving Properties​ Request { "method": "GET_PROPERTY", "params": [ "combined" ], "id": 2} Response { "result": true, // Indicates that combined is set to true.

Buffer the events received from the stream. Note the U of the first event you received. Get a depth snapshot from https://testnet.binance.vision/api/v3/depth?symbol=BNBBTC&limit=5000. If the lastUpdateId from the snapshot is strictly less than the U from step 2, go back to step 3. In the buffered events, discard any event where u is <= lastUpdateId of the snapshot. The first buffered event should now have lastUpdateId within its [U;u] range. Set your local order book to the snapshot. Its update ID is lastUpdateId. Apply the update procedure below to all buffered events, and then to all subsequent events received. To apply an event to your local order book, follow this update procedure: If the event u (last update ID) is < the update ID of your local order book, ignore the event. If the event U (first update ID) is > the update ID of your local order book, something went wrong. Discard your local order book and restart the process from the beginning. For each price level in bids (b) and asks (a), set the new quantity in the order book: If the price level does not exist in the order book, insert it with new quantity. If the quantity is zero, remove the price level from the order book. Set the order book update ID to the last update ID (u) in the processed event. [!NOTE] Since depth snapshots retrieved from the API have a limit on the number of price levels (5000 on each side maximum), you won't learn the quantities for the levels outside of the initial snapshot unless they change. So be careful when using the information for those levels, since they might not reflect the full view of the order book. However, for most use cases, seeing 5000 levels on each side is enough to understand the market and trade effectively.
